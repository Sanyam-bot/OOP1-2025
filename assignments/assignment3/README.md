This Java program demonstrates the use of methods, method overloading, handling arrays, and recursion.  
It includes:
- A method to calculate the sum of two numbers.
- Overloaded methods to multiply two or three numbers.
- A method to find the maximum value in an array.
- A recursive method to reverse a string.

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or higher).
- Any Java IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) or terminal/command prompt to compile and run.
